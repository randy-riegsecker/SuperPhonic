# SuperPhonic
SuperPhonic is a fun soundboard enjoyed by children and adults all over the world!  It plays 12 different sounds for use at a variety of social events and family functions.

The code is written in Java and the application was developed using Android Studio.  It demonstrates the use of a single Activity with Buttons and the SoundPool class to play short mp3 sound files.

Happy Noisemaking!
